This is a sample post to demonstrate how to add content to your website. You can write about your projects, experiences, or anything else you'd like to share.

## How to Add Posts

1. Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory
2. Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Include the front matter at the top with:
   - `layout: post`
   - `title: "Your Title"`
   - `categories: research` (or `industry` or `personal`)
   - `image: /images/your-image.jpg` (optional)
   - `excerpt: "Brief description"`

## Categories

- `research`: Shows in the main "Research" section
- `industry`: Shows in the "Industry Experience" section  
- `personal`: Shows in the "Other Projects" section

You can add any other category name, and it will appear in the "Other Projects" section.

## Adding Images

1. Add your images to the `images` folder
2. Reference them in posts with `/images/filename.jpg`
3. For thumbnails, the system will automatically look in the `tn/` folder
